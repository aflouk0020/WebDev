	why recycling is important
	</summary>
	<p>Recycling is an excellent way of saving energy and conserving the environment.<br>

1 recycled tin can would save enough energy to power a television for 3 hours.<br>
1 recycled glass bottle would save enough energy to power a computer for 25 minutes.<br>
1 recycled plastic bottle would save enough energy to power a 60-watt light bulb for 3 hours.<br>
70% less energy is required to recycle paper compared with making it from raw materials.</p>

	what would happen if we do not recycle
	</summary>
	<p>When we don't recycle, reuse and reduce, we destroy natural habitats. As it is, our earth cannot cope with the current rate of destruction. By failing to reuse what we already have, we'll end up in a sticky situation of running out of resources. Luckily, recycling is easy.

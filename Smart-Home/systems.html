              <p class="left">Here are some of information about the devices.</p>
              <p class="margin_button left button"><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-best-smart-home-devices">Click here for more info</a></p>
              <p class="left"><b>The Amazon Echo:</b> is a Bluetooth speaker powered by Alexa, Amazon's handy voice assistant. Alexa works with a number of smart home devices directly, as well as with If This Then That (IFTTT) to control plenty of others via pairings you can create yourself.</p>
              <p class="left"><b>Furbo Dog Camera:</b> It is essentially an indoor home security camera and dog nanny in one, offering clear 1080p video even in the dark, plus barking alerts and two-way audio so you can hear and talk to your pup. Perhaps best of all, it lets you toss treats to your pet when you're out and about. The Furbo Dog Camera is pricey, especially compared with traditional security cameras, but it's as useful as it is fun, and gives you peace of mind that your dog and home are safe.</p>
              <p class="left"><b>RemoBell S: </b> The new RemoBell S is a much slimmer device that gives you on-demand HD video, free cloud recording, support for Alexa and Google voice commands, and interoperability with other smart home devices using IFTTT applets</p>
              <p class="left"><b>Home Security Cameras: </b>It's the first model we've seen that streams and records video in true 4K, or Ultra High Definition (UHD), and it's loaded with cool tech including automatic zooming, motion tracking, color night vision, an integrated spotlight and siren, one-click 911 connectivity, a 180-degree field of view, and more. It's also completely wireless and a snap to install. </p>
            </div>
          <div>
            <p class="left"><b>SimpliSafe Home Security System: </b>The system is easy to set up and use, and keeps your home safe from intruders and environmental threats like fires and floods. It's a seamless solution that succeeds quite well at what it sets out to do—secure your home simply and flexibly, letting you monitor everything remotely with (or without) an affordable monthly plan.</p>
            <p class="left"><b>Smart Bed: </b>There are many ways to track your sleep these days, from fitness trackers to smartwatches, but perhaps nothing is better suited for the job than your mattress itself. At least, that's the idea behind Sleep Number's 360 Smart Bed, which incorporates biometric sensors to help you snooze better. You use an app on your smartphone to view your sleep trends and health metrics, and to gain insight on how you can sleep better.</p>

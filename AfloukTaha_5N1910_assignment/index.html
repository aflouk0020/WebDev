<h3>Short for HyperText Markup Language</h3>

<!-- paragraph  -->
<p>The authoring language used to create documents on the World Wide Web. HTML is similar to SGML, although it is not a strict subset.<br>
HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes. The correct structure for an HTML document starts with  HTML  HEAD(enter here what document is about) BODY and ends with  BODY HTML. All the information you'd like to include in your Web page fits in between the BODY and BODY tags.<br>
There are hundreds of other tags used to format and layout the information in a Web page. Tags are also used to specify hypertext links. These allow Web developers to direct users to other Web pages with only a click of the mouse on either an image or word(s). For a more complete list of tags, check out some of the URLs below.</p>

<h3>Cascading Style Sheet</h3>

<!-- paragraph  -->
<p>Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.<br>

CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.<br>

While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today incorporate cascading style sheets.</p>



<h2>What is FTP?</h2>

<h3>File Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>(FTP) is one way to get and transfer files between computers. The protocol is one of the oldest methods that is still used today; its early development started in 1971. It was developed as a mechanism for granting access to users so that they could access and use files on a specific system. An average internet user wouldn’t use FTP that often. As a website developer, however, it is instrumental.<br>
As stated above, FTP is a method to access and share files on the internet. The protocol is a way to communicate between computers on a TCP/IP network, the internet.  It’s used by users who have access to transfer and receive files in the FTP server (also known as FTP host/site). The access control is essential to prevent an unauthorized person from getting those files.<br>

Think about FTP like using Windows Explorer or a Finder on a laptop. With the help of such tools, the owner can get and move files – text, image or audio to a specific place in their drive.<br>

As a website developer, FTP is often used to make changes to a website. Given the large number of files that need to be handled, it is more comfortable and secure to use FTP to manage them. For example, you can move a web template, add image files, upload specific files to build the website, etc.</p>
